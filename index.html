	<h2>Thank you for 38 years!</h2>	
	<p>
		We are sad to announce that after 38 years of serving you, our physical store
		located at 76th and Beloit Road has permanently closed as of April 30, 2020 -
		<strong>but this is not the end!</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Although our building may be retired, we are not! Starting late-May 2020 we
		will begin offering in-home curbside and pick-up/drop-off for part sales and
		repair services. <a href="https://fb.me/WestAllisVacuum">Follow us on
		Facebook</a> for the latest updates as we continue to bring you the same
		quality services you've come to know and rely on right from the comfort of
		your home!

	<p>
		From our family to youars, <strong>thank you</strong> bottom of our hearts for
		your support over the years and as we transition to this new era.
