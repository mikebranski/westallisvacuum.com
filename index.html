	<h2>Thank you for 38 years!</h2>	
	<p>
		We are sad to announce that after 38 years of serving you, our physical store
		located at 76th and Beloit Road has permanently closed as of April 30, 2020,
		and we have ceased our mobile operation as of spring 2021.

		From our family to yours, <strong>thank you</strong> from the bottom of our
		hearts for your support over the years. It has meant the world to us.
