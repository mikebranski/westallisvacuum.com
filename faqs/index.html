<h2>How often should I change my vacuum bag?</h2>
<p>You should change your bag before it is full, at least 1-2 times every six months. A lot depends on what you are vacuuming – fine dust and pet hair/dander will clog your bag much faster than ordinary dust and dirt. A new bag and filter will prolong the life of your vacuum. When your bag is too full, you will notice your vacuum not picking up as well as it once did.</p>

<h2>How often should I change my vacuum belt?</h2>
<p>Most belts should be changed at least once a year. When vacuum belts stretch, they no longer turn the brush roll at the correct speed for maximum cleaning. Signs that you’ve waited too long to change your belt include a squeaking sound when your vacuum starts up, or a burning smell!</p>

<h2>How often should I change my vacuum filter?</h2>
<p>Most manufacturers recommend replacing filters every six months, or at least once a year. When your filter is old or clogged, the vacuum motor can overheat, shortening the life of the motor and reducing suction. When you change your filter, write the date for the next recommended change right on the filter. This will ensure you never go too long between filter changes.</p>

<h2>How often should I have my vacuum cleaner tuned up?</h2>
<p>To maintain peak performance, you should have your vacuum tuned up every other year.</p>

<h2>What is a HEPA filter?</h2>
<p>HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air. HEPA filters capture 99.97% of all particles greater than 0.3 micrometre. HEPA filters were developed in the 1940s to prevent the spread of airborne radioactive contaminants. Today, HEPA filters can be beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers because the filter traps the fine particles that can trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. HEPA filters are fully effective only when used on a “sealed system” vacuum.</p>

<h2>Do HEPA-type filters work as well as HEPA filters?</h2>
<p>While HEPA-type filter or paper bags often use construction or fibers similar to those used in a true HEPA filter, they may not have been tested in independent laboratories. Some HEPA-type filters and bags may come close to meeting HEPA filtration requirements, but others may fall significantly short of HEPA specifications.</p>

<h2>What is the best vacuum cleaner for someone with allergies?</h2>
<p>A vacuum with an anti-allergy paper bag is far superior to a bagless vaccum for people with allergies, as vacuum bags improve filtration. Because bagless vacuums do not have a bag, the filters clog more quickly, reducing suction and lowering cleaning effectiveness. In addition, when the bagless vacuum container is emptied, dust and other allergens become airborne.</p>

<h2>Do higher amp vacuums clean better?</h2>
<p>Not necessarily. Amps are a measurement of the amount of electricity the machine uses, while cleaning ability is determined by the amount of air flow the vacuum produces. A larger, more efficient fan can produce more airflow using fewer amps.</p>

<h2>Which is better – a canister or upright vacuum cleaner?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are excellent for cleaning carpeting. Canisters work best on hard surface floors. However, attachments are available that increase the versatility of each type of vacuum so each can cover all your cleaning needs.</p>

<h2>Do generic vacuum bags work as well as name-brand bags?</h2>
<p>Not necessarily. Many generic bags are made of a thinner paper than name-brand bags. This can reduce the amount of dust trapped and allow more dust to escape. The use of generic bags may also void some manufacturers’ warranties, so be sure to check your warranty before switching to generic bags.</p>
