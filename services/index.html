<h2>Expert Vacuum Repair &amp; Service</h2>
<p>We’ve built our reputation on providing good, honest service – if your vacuum can be repaired for a reasonable price, we’ll tell you. And if it isn’t worth fixing, we’ll let you know that, too. Whether you decide to repair your machine or not, <strong>the estimate is always free.</strong></p>
<p>Many common vacuum repairs can be made for under $20. In addition, we often have used parts available that you can choose for us to use in your repair, which can help lower of the cost of fixing your vacuum.</p>
<p>We’re factory authorized by Panasonic, Cirrus and Kirby – and our service expertise extends across most other vacuum brands:</p>
